Note: This dataset, and the lexicon used to construction it, are revised/curated versions of those which are mentioned in the EMNLP 2020 paper to include 447 additional health-related claims in order to assist with ongoing COVID-19 fact checking efforts. Some instances have been omitted from the dataset either due to limited relevance, because the claim was poorly defined or due to multiple instances of near identical claims in the dataset. The methodology employed to acquire these new dataset instances is the same as that which is mentioned in the EMNLP paper.
